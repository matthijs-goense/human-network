A web based tool to visualise human networks (hobby project by a non programmer)

=============

This is a hobby project. I'm trying to build a webbased tool that uses vis.js (http://visjs.org/#example) and jquery to 
manage and visualise human networks. 
I have no programming background so realy DO NOT USE THIS CODE FOR IMPORTANT STUFF!
